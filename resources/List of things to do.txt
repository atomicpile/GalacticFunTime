List of things still needed with approximate dimensions:

Various kinds of lasers/projectiles
	approximately 10x10, 10x20
	lasers (think Star Wars) are better as 10x20 whereas other projectiles would be better as 10x10
	
Various kinds of turrets
	maybe 50x50?
	
Background image/images
	In the future I can implement a world map, and multiple images can be used to generate variety in 
	the world...not a high priority now
	
Shields
	Different colored shields for different kinds of ships
	Blue or cyan
	green
	purple
	these can be either oval or circle shaped.  I believe I can scale a circle lengthwise to make an oval if
	need be, depending on the unit
